# Welcome to Yuanji's wiki

This's my personal wiki where I share what I know. It's powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

I deploy this website on [Cloudflare Pages](sysadmin/cloudflare.md#deploy-a-mkdocs-site).

## Configurations

You can find all configurations in `mkdocs.yml`, to enable YAML schema validation add the following line at the top of it.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json
```

## Run locally

- Clone repository & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masakichi/wiki.git
cd wiki
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install #(1)
```

1.  It will setup [pre-commit hooks](coding/git.md#pre-commit)

- Launch development server

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
