# Welcome to Yuanji's Wiki

This is my personal wiki where I share what I know. It is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Run locally

- Clone repo & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masakichi/wiki.git

python -m venv venv

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Launch dev server

```

## TODO

- Make categories more clear
