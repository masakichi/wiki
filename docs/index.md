# Welcome to Yuanji's Wiki

This's my personal wiki where I share what I know. It's powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

I deploy this website on [Cloudflare Pages](sysadmin/cloudflare.md#deploy-a-docusaurus-site).

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
