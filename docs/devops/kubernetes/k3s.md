## Troubleshooting

### Failed to pull image

When you try to create a pod, you may meet following issue due to domain names not being resolved.

```
Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get sandbox image "rancher/mirrored-pause:3.6": failed to pull image "rancher/mirrored-pause:3.6": failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/rancher/mirrored-pause:3.6": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/rancher/mirrored-pause:3.6": failed to do request: Head "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/rancher/mirrored-pause/manifests/3.6": dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io: Try again
```

To solve this problem, you can check if `/etc/resolv.conf` this file on your host server is correctly configured. If you use systemd-resolved, you can try:

```bash
sudo ln -rsf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```
