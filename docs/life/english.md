## Style

### Avoid passive voice

> if you don’t want your readers to know who is performing an action, or if the action itself is more important than who performed the action, you might choose to use a passive voice.

> In short, when used thoughtfully, a passive voice can be a useful tool, but in most cases, switching to an active voice will make your writing clearer, livelier and far more enjoyable to read.

### E-Prime

> E-Prime (short for English-Prime or English Prime, sometimes denoted É or E′) refers to a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be, including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms.
