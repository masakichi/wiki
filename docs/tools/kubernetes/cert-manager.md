> cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.
>
> It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI.
>
> It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

## Creating Issuers/ClusterIssuers

:::info Issuer vs ClusterIssuer

An Issuer is a namespaced resource, and it is not possible to issue certificates from an Issuer in a different namespace. This means you will need to create an Issuer in each namespace you wish to obtain Certificates in.

If you want to create a single Issuer that can be consumed in multiple namespaces, you should consider creating a ClusterIssuer resource. This is almost identical to the Issuer resource, however is non-namespaced so it can be used to issue Certificates across all namespaces.

-- <cite>[Issuer | cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/#namespaces)</cite>

Following example creates an ACME ClusterIssuer using Cloudflare as DNS01 challenge provider:

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Secret" default>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloudflare-api-token
  namespace: cert-manager
type: Opaque
stringData:
  api-token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClusterIssuer">

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    email: production@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-account-key
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          cloudflare:
            apiTokenSecretRef:
              name: cloudflare-api-token
              key: api-token
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClusterIssuer(Staging)">

:::tip Staging environment

You can test against the [ACME v2 staging environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/) before using production environment. This will allow you to get things right before issuing trusted certificates and reduce the chance of your running up against rate limits.

:::

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    email: staging@example.com
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging-account-key
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          cloudflare:
            apiTokenSecretRef:
              name: cloudflare-api-token
              key: api-token
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating certificates

You can use following example to issue a certificate:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-com-wildcard
spec:
  secretName: example-com-wildcard-tls
  renewBefore: 360h # 15d
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
    - "*.example.com"
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```

Ref: [Certificate Resources | cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/)

## Using certificates

You can refer to a certificate in `Ingress` by using `secretName` like following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: whoami
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "traefik"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - whoami.example.com
      # highlight-next-line
      secretName: example-com-wildcard-tls #(1)
  rules:
    - host: whoami.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: whoami
                port:
                  number: 80
```

1.  Refer to the certificate you created in the [previous step](#creating-certificates)
